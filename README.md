# Temple fun 

Temple fun is temple run reimagined into real life where I take the idea of temple run by making you control your character using real life actions. 

## why real life actions? what is the real world problem this addresses?
 it addresses obesity and helps kid move more without being extremley physically demanding like other sports. Ex: basketball and soccer


## why not use a VR head set
you can use a VR headset, but we want to create an option for a cheaper alternative that still gives you the feeling of being active. Also people cannot use a VR headset for long without feeling claustro phobic.


## why not Kinect?
Kinect was buggy, required a lot of space, was expensive and honestly not made at the right time because the industry wasnt really moving in that direction yet. 

## game mechanics 
To run, you need to spot jog  
to jump, you need to actulualy jump  
to step left , you need to jump left  
to step right, you need to jump right
